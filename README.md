##  How It Works

- The menu is stored in a **Python dictionary** with items as *keys* and prices as *values*.  
- The program repeatedly asks for the customer‚Äôs order until they choose to stop.  
- Each valid order‚Äôs price is added to the total bill.  
- The program prompts for additional orders and handles unavailable items gracefully.  
- Finally, the total bill is displayed along with a thank-you message.

##  Example Output


*Explanation of Example Output:*  
- The user orders **Tea**, **Pizza**, an unavailable item **Sandwich**, and then **Coffee**.  
- The program adds the prices of valid items (Tea + Pizza + Coffee = 29 + 69 + 89 = 187) and shows the final bill.  
- The system handles invalid orders gracefully and prompts the user until they decide to stop.
